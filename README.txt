Perfect Minimum N Cube is combination of cubes on 3D space which satisfies following conditions. 

1. N is integer variable.
2. The geometry is a combination of size 1 cube , every edges are alined to X or Y or Z direction.
3. The number of cubes is N*N .
4. When the geoemtry projected on XY,YZ,XZ plane, it's boundary becomes perfect length N square.

The concept of Perfect Minimum N Cube was developed during pavilion design project on yonsei university architectural design studio 3, 2010. The geometry could be read as N*N*N size cube cloud with only N*N cubes.
Initially, possible combination of Perfect Minimum N cube when n=4 were hand calculated with help of Kangdacool.
2016, development of code started to generate disirable combinations of Perfect Minimum N Cube.
